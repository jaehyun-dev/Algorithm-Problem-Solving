### 문제 설명

<p>Chinese people are known for their difficulty with pronouncing the "R". Often the "R" is replaced by the "L", like in "radio", which becomes "ladio". Especially when a secondary language is involved, the examples become very colourful. For example, in Spanish the "V" is pronounced like a soft "B". In South-America it is most disturbing to hear a Dutch young couple shout " Famos, Famos!". To give another well-known example, the English pronunciation of "th" is in The Netherlands often replaced by a loud "S", which results, for example, in announcing the program "NorS and SouS".</p>

<p>At a young age, children often have diffculties with certain letters as well (although luckily, they usually get over it quite soon). Sascha, a 3 year old girl, also doesn’t succeed in pronouncing a number of letters. She just replaces them with another letter which she finds easier to pronounce. It became a problem when she started to replace many letters by the same letter. This forced her parents to use a lot of creativity and imagination when trying to figure out what the original word was that she meant. Additional skills were required when they noticed that her "replacement"-rules weren't consistent. For example, Sascha can clearly pronounce an "R" at the beginning of a word, while substituting the "R" in the middle of a word. This can even happen within the same word!</p>

<p>Your job is to write a translation program to figure out the original word Sascha wanted to say. You have to find the most likely word, given a dictionary of proper words. The most likely word is the word in the dictionary that can be found with the least number of substitutions. A substitution consists of replacing a single letter by another letter. The different letters which cause speech difficulties are not given. Neither is the replacement letter.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>The first line of input consists of the integer number n (0 < n ≤ 10000), the number of test cases;</li>
	<li>Then, for each test case:
	<ul>
		<li>One line with the word as Sascha pronounced it;</li>
		<li>One line with an integer w (0 < w ≤ 10000), the number of words in the dictionary;</li>
		<li>Then w lines with one word each: the dictionary.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>All words consist of lower case letters and never exceed 128 characters in length. All words in the dictionary have the same length as the word that Sascha pronounced.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, the output contains one line with one word: the word that Sascha most likely meant to say. When multiple words would be possible, a word that appears earlier in the dictionary is more likely.</p>
